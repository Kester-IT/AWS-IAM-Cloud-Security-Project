# AWS-IAM-Cloud-Security-Project
A hands-on AWS cloud security project implementing least-privilege IAM policies with tag-based EC2 access control. The project restricts start/stop actions on Audit-tagged instances while allowing them on Sales-tagged ones, demonstrating practical IAM security, policy design, and verification.
